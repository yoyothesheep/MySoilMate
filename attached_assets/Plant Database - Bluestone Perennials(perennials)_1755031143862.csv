To help avoid the possibility of mildew; provide plants with good air circulation (in spring, snip out all but 4-6 stems in a mature clump), avoid drought-like conditions, site plants where they will get sufficient light of eight hours or more each day. Should a spray program become necessary, products exist on the market for prevention and control. Removing mature blooms will prevent seeding, if not desired. Clean up spent foliage in spring.

Our plant spacing recommendations are based on how quickly groundcovers will spread in their first season of growth.",https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/img/GEIV/300/GEIV-0a-geranium-ingwersens-variety1-nc.jpg.webp,https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/GEIV,"Full Sun, Mostly Sun, Half Sun / Half Shade, Mostly Shade",Full Sun to Mostly Shady,,Late Spring to Early Summer,"spring,summer","Perennials,

Allow seeds to fall to assure permanence in the garden. Spent flower heads can be cut back to prevent too many volunteers. Can be divided every 4 years in spring. Spent foliage can be cut back to 6"" for a flush of new growth.

Flowers in this series appear 2 weeks earlier than other Lupines. No staking needed. Great companion plants for heavy-feeding vegetables like cucumber, squash, cabbage and also fruit trees. Did you know that Lupines can improve the fertility of the soils in which they grow? Plants belonging to the Legume family like Lupines are often called nitrogen fixers. All plants need nitrogen for growing and Lupines are able to take nitrogen from the air with the help of special soil bacteria that live within nodules on their roots and convert nitrogen into a form that can be used by nearby plants.",https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/img/LUYE/300/LUYE_0_Lupine_Mini_Gallery_Yellow_wg.jpg.webp,https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/LUYE,"Full Sun, Mostly Sun",Full Sun to Mostly Sunny,,Late Spring to Mid-Summer,"spring,summer",Perennials,"

Vanilla-scented flowers emerge in attractive branching clusters. As quoted by George Carlin; “The caterpillar does all the work, but the butterfly gets all the publicity.” This U.S. native perennial will ensure a reliable food source for butterflies. The slender seed pods of Asclepias Soulmate in late summer throughout winter provide four-season appeal. The pods, usually in pairs, burst open in fall to reveal brown seeds on silky threads that hitch a ride with the breeze like glistening parachutes. Plants will emerge late in the spring but require little care once established.

      Lupine polyphyllus 'Mini Gallery™ Blue Bicolor' 
    ","Two-toned violet-purple and white flowers with compact habit flourish with warm sunny days and cool nights. From the Mini Gallery™ Series; tightly-packed, sweet pea-shaped blossoms in a breathtaking array of colors invite pollinators to their nectar-rich spires. Flowers in this series appear 2 weeks earlier than other Lupines. No staking needed. Great companion plants for heavy-feeding vegetables like cucumber, squash, cabbage and also fruit trees. Did you know that Lupines can improve the fertility of the soils in which they grow? Plants belonging to the Legume family like Lupines are often called nitrogen fixers. All plants need nitrogen for growing and Lupines are able to take nitrogen from the air with the help of special soil bacteria that live within nodules on their roots and convert nitrogen into a form that can be used by nearby plants.",https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/img/LUBB/300/LUBB_0_Lupine_Mini_Gallery_Blue_Bicolor2_wg.jpg.webp,https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/LUBB,"Full Sun, Mostly Sun",Full Sun to Mostly Sunny,,Late Spring to Mid-Summer,"spring,summer",Perennials,"

This series is touted for its improved heat and drought tolerance and cold tolerance to zone 3 has also been reported. Astilbe Younique Salmon was developed by Dutch hybridizer, Jan Verschoor. They bloom about 2 weeks before other Astilbe. Astilbe are mainstays of shade and woodland gardens. They combine well with other moisture-loving plants like Brunnera, Ligularia, Lobelia and Hosta.

Its branching habit results in significant rebloom resulting in a longer blooming season. This variety exhibits a strong, pleasant lavender fragrance that is floral rather than pungent.

    ","Lovely for patio planting, this compact variety with layered pointed petals is silvery pink, perfectly edged in purple. Dark anthers are tipped in glowing citron. Named for volunteer work that Samaritans offer to others – all volunteers are known as Samaritan Jo. From the Boulevard® Series, renowned for its easy care and bushy, long-blooming, compact habit, this Clematis is perfect for gardeners who lack full sun. Blooms June-July and again in September.

    ","The profile of this variety is shorter and wider than our other Iberis offerings. Evergreen foliage is dark green and semi-glossy, making for an attractive appearance all season. White flowers, spring to early summer, provide a sparkling contrast against its dark foliage. A light shearing after blooming is all that is required. The white flowers of Iberis Snow Cushion add classic elegance and a sense of serenity. Enliven an evening garden as its crisp white blossoms will reflect the moonlight. Candy Tuft, an evergreen subshrub, is deer resistant and pollinator friendly.

Gently place the pot (minus the wrapper) into the hole so that the first set of leaf nodes (the bud where the leaf sprouts from) is below ground. Remove any leaves that will be under the soil. Fill the hole halfway and tie the top growth to your trellis (leave the stick it shipped with in place for now) and water. Finish filling the hole with good soil, and water well. Your Clematis will appreciate a low growing plant at its feet to shade its roots. TYPE 2: First flowering comes from old stems and then later flowering occurs on new growth. In early spring, look for swelling leaf buds beginning to show. Remove any dead brittle material above these buds. Re-tie stems as needed.

Gently place the pot (minus the wrapper) into the hole so that the first set of leaf nodes (the bud where the leaf sprouts from) is below ground. Remove any leaves that will be under the soil. Fill the hole halfway and tie the top growth to your trellis (leave the stick it shipped with in place for now) and water. Finish filling the hole with good soil, and water well. Your Clematis will appreciate a low growing plant at its feet to shade its roots. TYPE 2: First flowering comes from old stems and then later flowering occurs on new growth. In early spring, look for swelling leaf buds beginning to show. Remove any dead brittle material above these buds. Re-tie stems as needed. If intertwining Clematis, pruning will be easier if you select varieties with the same pruning type. Want to sort by pruning type? In the main search box, type Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 to group them together.

    ","Long-lived and heavy-flowering, bright rose flower clusters on rosy-red stems stand above its rosette of glossy, cabbage-like foliage. Moss-green leaves deepen in the winter with a burgundy halo and remain evergreen in milder climates. From the Vintage™ series, the sturdy foliage of Bergenia Vintage Rose is a nice filler in cut flower bouquets. Pig Squeak will tolerate a wide range of soil conditions and performs well in dappled sun or shade. Rub the leathery leaves between two fingers after a summer rain to discover why this lovely perennial would have such an unusual common name, Pig Squeak.

Because Clematis Stand by Me is non-vining, it is ideal for a border and does not require a trellis. However, this bush Clematis can benefit from support from neighboring plants, cages, or staking. From Walters Gardens, Hans Hansen - a cross of two non-vining species, Clematis integrifolia x fremontii.

With billowing, silvery-green, aromatic foliage and long-blooming, lavender-purple flower spikes, this compact catmint is also ideal as a gently spreading groundcover or tucked into containers.

    ","This carefree little guy has frosty gray-blue foliage sporting a hazy overcast of plum. Clusters of fragrant, dark-pink flowers open from dusky red buds creating a vibrant appearance. Sedum Blue Elf is an intergeneric hybrid from a cross between Sedum and Orostachys – both in the Stonecrop family. Part of the SunSparkler Series, these enticing beauties are selected for their dazzling flower and foliage hues. Foliage colors are retained from spring through fall. Compact mounded habit forms a solid tight mat of foliage. Excellent as an underplanting, lovely cascading down a slope, or for use on green roof systems.",https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/img/SEBE/300/SEBE-0-Sedum-Blue-Elf-bl.jpg.webp,https://www.bluestoneperennials.com/SEBE,"Full Sun, Mostly Sun",Full Sun to Mostly Sunny,,Late Summer to Early Fall,"summer,fall",Perennials,"

    ","Long-lasting pink plumes shoot skyward atop a neat mound of slender foliage blades. Due to its lack of seed production, plumes are produced for a long-lasting show from mid-summer into late fall.

Perfect for full-sun borders. The seed heads can be used as a lovely addition to fresh and dried flower arrangements.

    ","This Leading Lady models violet-pink spiky, tousled blossom heads – garden bed head is in style! Each tubular petal is highlighted with lighter throats speckled with burgundy. Well-behaved, it stays where you plant it. Monarda Leading Lady Series are carefree, strong growers. Performing a little earlier than most Bee Balms, our Leading Ladies take center stage in early summer. Just about a foot tall, the blossoms will gain celebrity status with an audience of butterflies, hummingbirds, and bees; but deer tend to refrain from nibbling. With its petite stature, they are perfectly sized to tuck in the front of any sunny border or edge a garden path.

            ","Pruning Type 3. Clematis have some personality quirks. They are one of the few plants that like to be planted deeper. Pick a full sun site and have your trellis in place. Have a deep hole dug – 8-10"" – with some compost in the bottom.

            ","Pruning Type 2. Clematis have some personality quirks. They are one of the few plants that like to be planted deeper. Pick a full sun site and have your trellis in place. Have a deep hole dug – 8-10"" – with some compost in the bottom. Gently place the pot (minus the wrapper) into the hole so that the first set of leaf nodes (the bud where the leaf sprouts from) is below ground. Remove any leaves that will be under the soil. Fill the hole halfway and tie the top growth to your trellis (leave the stick it shipped with in place for now) and water. Finish filling the hole with good soil, and water well. Your Clematis will appreciate a low growing plant at its feet to shade its roots. TYPE 2: First flowering comes from old stems and then later flowering occurs on new growth.

    Pruning Type 2. Clematis have some personality quirks. They are one of the few plants that like to be planted deeper. Pick a full sun site and have your trellis in place. Have a deep hole dug – 8-10"" – with some compost in the bottom. Gently place the pot (minus the wrapper) into the hole so that the first set of leaf nodes (the bud where the leaf sprouts from) is below ground. Remove any leaves that will be under the soil. Fill the hole halfway and tie the top growth to your trellis (leave the stick it shipped with in place for now) and water. Finish filling the hole with good soil, and water well. Your Clematis will appreciate a low growing plant at its feet to shade its roots. TYPE 2: First flowering comes from old stems and then later flowering occurs on new growth. In early spring, look for swelling leaf buds beginning to show. Remove any dead brittle material above these buds. Re-tie stems as needed. If intertwining Clematis, pruning will be easier if you select varieties with the same pruning type. Want to sort by pruning type? In the main search box, type Type 1, Type 2 or Type 3 to group them together.

    Prefers moist, humus-rich soil. Phlox can be divided every 3-5 years in spring or fall. In spring, just as new growth appears, dig up the plant and divide clump with a sharp knife or spade into at least 2 or 3 shoots and a portion of the root system. Plants divided in fall should be mulched with a 4-6” layer of straw or pine needles to prevent heaving. Remove mulch in early spring. Cut back by 1/2 in late spring/early summer to encourage more compact plants. Shear off spent blooms just above foliage. To help avoid the possibility of mildew; provide plants with good air circulation (in spring, snip out all but 4-6 stems in a mature clump), avoid drought-like conditions, site plants where they will get sufficient light of eight hours or more each day. Should a spray program become necessary, products exist on the market for prevention and control. Removing mature blooms will prevent seeding, if not desired. Clean up spent foliage in spring.
